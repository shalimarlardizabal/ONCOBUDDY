# ONCO BUDDY

Onco Buddy is a full-stack web application designed to assist cancer patients in becoming more active participants in managing their health. Going through chemotherapy can be very daunting, and the vast amount of information available about cancer can be hard to navigate. Onco Buddy provides personalized information based on the userâ€™s diagnosis and treatments. The daily log feature allows users to keep track of their daily pain level, fatigue, sleep, and appetite. In addition, users can record symptoms and when they have administered treatments. The calendar feature allows visualization of treatment dates and the onset of symptoms.
